            <strong>About</strong>
            <br />
            Waachak (meaning reader in Hindi language) is a free RSS Reader service. Enjoy!
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Application</strong>
            <br />
            This RSS reader is using AngularJS and .Net Web APIs with SQL Server as the backend database.
            The complete source code can be downloaded free at Github  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/waachak">here</a>.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Why another reader?</strong>
            <br />
            Just because... I was playing with AngularJS and ended up building this application. It has been a lot of fun!
